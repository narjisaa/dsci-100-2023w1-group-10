    "## Introduction\n",
    "Diabetes Mellitus is a health condition which affects how an individual’s body processes the sugar, glucose. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients have a low concentration of the hormone, insulin, which typically promotes the uptake of glucose into cells as a source of stored energy. Therefore, lower levels of insulin will lead to increased levels of blood glucose ultimately resulting in the chronic illness of diabetes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using our Kaggle derived dataset originally sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, we will work to answer the question: can glucose concentration, insulin levels, and Body Mass Index (BMI) data determine whether an individual has diabetes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The presented dataset is about female diabetic patients of ages 21 or older from the Pima Indian heritage. The following columns are included: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Pregnancies (the number of pregnancies the patient had)\n",
    "    - **pregnancies**\n",
    "- Glucose (Plasma glucose concentration, a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test. $mg/dL$)\n",
    "    - **glucose**\n",
    "- Blood Pressure (Diastolic blood pressure in $mm\\,Hg$)\n",
    "    - **blood_pressure**\n",
    "- Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in $mm$)\n",
    "    - **skin_thickness**\n",
    "- Insulin (2 Hour serum insulin in $\\mu U/mL$)\n",
    "    - **insulin**\n",
    "- BMI (Body Mass Index in $kg/m^2$)\n",
    "    - **bmi**\n",
    "- Diabetes pedigree function (uncommon genetic measure of the likelihood that a patient will have diabetes based on family history)\n",
    "    - **dpf**\n",
    "- Age (years)\n",
    "    - **age**\n",
